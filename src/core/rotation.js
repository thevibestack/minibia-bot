/**
 * Ordered rule registry rotation engine (REQ-03, design D9).
 *
 * The engine evaluates configured rules per tick in configured order and fires
 * AT MOST ONE action per tick. When two rules are feasible, the earlier in
 * order wins and the other is deferred to the next tick. `repeat` keeps a rule
 * eligible on subsequent ticks while feasible, up to N executions; the rule
 * then completes and stays dormant until its condition re-satisfies (it must
 * be observed false, then true again — e.g. mana re-crossing the threshold) or
 * it is explicitly re-armed via `rearm(ruleId)`.
 *
 * Rule shape:
 *   {
 *     id: string,
 *     order?: number,                    // lower runs first; defaults to index
 *     condition: (ctx) => boolean,       // is this rule feasible this tick?
 *     action: (ctx) => void,             // side effect; at most one per tick
 *     repeat?: number,                   // executions before completion (default 1)
 *   }
 *
 * The shared `ctx` is a mutable context object (mana, cooldowns, timers, ...)
 * that conditions read and actions write.
